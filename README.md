# object-detection-in-adverse-weather-using-YOLOv3
- This project aims to adaptively enhance object detection in challenging weather conditions, using a
combination of a CNN, an image processing module, and YOLO v3.
- VOC 2007 train and test datasets were used for this project, which contain 20
different annotated classes. However, the following five classes were used for 
training and testing: person, bus, car, bicycle, and motorbike.    

Libraries used in this project:
- Numpy 1.24.4
- Torchvision 0.15.2
- Torch 2.0.1
- Tqdm 4.65.0
- opencv-python 4.1.1
- Python 3.10
